          <p class="lead">Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.
                Prevention: Mosquito nets, insect repellent, mo...
                Specialty: Infectious disease
                Symptoms: Fever, vomiting, headache
                Causes: Plasmodium spread by mosquitos</p>

          <p>It is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group.[2] The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito.[2] The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood.[2] The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce.[1] Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans.[1] Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum because P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria.[1][2] The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans.[2] Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.[1] Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity.</p>

              Changes in physical and emotional reactions
              
              Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:
              
              Being easily startled or frightened
              Always being on guard for danger
              Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast
              Trouble sleeping
              Trouble concentrating
              Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior
              Overwhelming guilt or shame
              For children 6 years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include:
              
              Re-enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play
              Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event
              Intensity of symptoms
              
              PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault.
              
              When to see a doctor
              
              If you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, if they're severe, or if you feel you're having trouble getting your life back under control, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse.
              
              If you have suicidal thoughts
              
              If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts, get help right away through one or more of these resources:
              
              Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
              Contact a minister, a spiritual leader or someone in your faith community.
              Call a suicide hotline number — in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor. Use that same number and press 1 to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
              Make an appointment with your doctor or a mental health professional.
              When to get emergency help
              
              If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.</p>

                    Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium (phylum Apicomplexa). In humans, malaria is caused by P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi.[22][23] Among those infected, P. falciparum is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by P. vivax (~20%).[5] Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,[24] recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.[25] P. vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa.[26] There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes; however, except for P. knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques[23]—these are mostly of limited public health importance.[27]
