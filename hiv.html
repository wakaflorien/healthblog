          <p class="lead">Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[9][10][11] Following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness.[4] Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms.[5] As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have uncompromised immune systems.[4] These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[5] This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.[5]</p>

          <p>HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[12] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[13] Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and male circumcision.[4] Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication.[4] There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy.[5][6] Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.[14] Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.[</p>

              Changes in physical and emotional reactions
              
              Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:
              
              Being easily startled or frightened
              Always being on guard for danger
              Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast
              Trouble sleeping
              Trouble concentrating
              Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior
              Overwhelming guilt or shame
              For children 6 years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include:
              
              Re-enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play
              Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event
              Intensity of symptoms
              
              PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault.
              
              When to see a doctor
              
              If you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, if they're severe, or if you feel you're having trouble getting your life back under control, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse.
              
              If you have suicidal thoughts
              
              If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts, get help right away through one or more of these resources:
              
              Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
              Contact a minister, a spiritual leader or someone in your faith community.
              Call a suicide hotline number â€” in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor. Use that same number and press 1 to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
              Make an appointment with your doctor or a mental health professional.
              When to get emergency help
              
              If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.</p>

                    Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[301] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[
